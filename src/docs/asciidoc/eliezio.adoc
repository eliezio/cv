Contributed to the link:https://reg.rf.oracle.com/flow/oracle/ocw25/catalog/page/catalog/session/1747952312438001OwCn[company’s cloud transformation initiative], focusing on the migration of cryptographic infrastructure from IBM z/OS ICSF to cloud-based HSM solutions.

* Led the development of a core service to centralize and secure key-managed cryptographic operations across applications.
* Designed the service to route requests to downstream cloud HSM providers (initially AWS CloudHSM, later Oracle OCI Vault), with built-in fallback and retry mechanisms.
* Accelerated migration and reduced integration complexity by decoupling client applications from specific HSM implementations.
* Collaborated with Information Security Group to ensure secure key management and compliance during the transition from on-premises to cloud-based environments.
