s|“link:https://www.beeline.com[Beeline Inc.] (formerly Utmost)”, Senior Backend Software Engineer
|Dublin, Ireland

2+a|
* I tackled the GraphQL N+1 problem by introducing graphql-dataloader to critical sub-resolvers, advocating its benefits to backend developers, and providing mentoring for adoption. This led to significantly faster query response times and reduced database load.
* I developed tools for integration tests that use datasource instrumentation to detect excessive queries caused by Spring Data/Hibernate mappings. This eliminated the issue in critical queries, improving efficiency.
* Authored the OSS project dbQueryWatch (https://github.com/dbquerywatch/dbquerywatch).
* _Kotlin, Spring Boot, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, Hibernate, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Testcontainers, ArchUnit, Gradle, Gitlab_


|08.2021 – 03.2022
|
s|“link:https://teckro.com/[Teckro Ltd]”, Senior Backend Software Engineer
|Dublin, Ireland

|
|
2+a|
* I introduced integration tests using a client generated from the OpenAPI spec and ensured only the spec was published to the local Maven repository. This eliminated contract breaks between REST services typical in the contract-last approach.
* _Kotlin, Spring Boot, REST API, OpenAPI 3, MySQL, AWS, Docker, Kotest, JUnit 5, Testcontainers_

|2020 – 2021
|
s|“link:https://aetion.com/[Aetion Inc.] (contractor via link:https://www.brq.com/[BRQ])”, Senior DevOps Engineer
|New York, USA

|
|
2+a|
* I automated MySQL access management by implementing a GitOps-like engine that created temporary accounts based on a simple config file and removed them after a set time. A Flask-based front-end allowed users to request access via a bastion host, reducing the process to minutes while ensuring full automation and auditability.
** OSS Backend: https://github.com/eliezio/sari
** OSS Frontend: https://github.com/eliezio/sari-web
* _Python 3, Pulumi, Terraform, MySQL, SAML, AWS (IAM, Lambda, RDS, APIGW, CodeBuild, ECR, S3, CloudWatch, Glue), Okta, Docker, Packer, Testcontainers, JavaScript, jQuery, Axios, Bootstrap_

|01.2019 – 07.2020
|
s|“link:https://www.est.tech/[Ericsson Software Technology AB]”, Senior Engineer
|Athlone, Ireland

|
|
2+a|
* I implemented automated acceptance tests using pact-like interactions in YAML, eliminating disruptive ONAP CCSDK updates. This saved hours of debugging per release, allowing Ericsson’s team to focus on new features.

** link:++https://github.com/onap/ccsdk-cds/commits?author=eliezio.oliveira@est.tech++[My contributions to ONAP CCSDK]
* I developed a NETCONF emulator using sysrepo and Netopeer2 for automated integration tests, initially for my project and later generalized for other Ericsson teams. This improved reliability and significantly reduced errors in NETCONF-related features.
* _Kotlin, Python 3, Spring Boot, Mockito, Docker Compose, WireMock, Pitest_

|2018

s|“link:https://komodoplatform.com/en/[Komodo]”, Freelancer
|Zurich, Switzerland

|
|
2+a|
* Developed a smart client that auto-learned commands, sub-commands, and options from the server’s /help endpoint, ensuring a robust, adaptable tool compatible with future Market Maker versions.
* _C, REST API, Google C++ Test Framework, Sonarqube, CMake_

s|“link:https://www.riocardmais.com.br/[RioCard Tecnologia]”, Lead Software Developer
|Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

|
|
2+a|
* Designed a secure, high-performance architecture for top-up terminals, cutting processing time from 15s to under 1s. Shifted 99.9% of processing to a central server, ensuring system security and seamless third-party integration, enabling RioCard expansion across hundreds of ATMs.
* Redesigned the online card processing front-end, applying UX principles to improve usability. Developed a Single-Page Application with better hierarchy and contrast, making recharge operations more intuitive and user-friendly.
* Developed a C-based SDK that improved RioCard validator integration by delegating sensitive operations to a Secure Authentication Module (SAM), enhancing security and increasing validator supplier competition.
* _Java 8, JCE, Spring Boot, Spock Framework, TDD, Spring RESTDocs, MyBatis, JavaScript, jQuery, SOLID, Cryptography, C, Google C++ Test Framework, SAM, MIFARE Classic/Plus, HSM (IBM z/OS ICSF), Jenkins, Prometheus, Grafana_

s|“MUXI Tech (now link:https://dock.tech/en/[Dock])”, Lead Software Developer
|Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

|
|
2+a|
* Developed an IP stack for payment terminals with minimal RAM, enabling internet-based services beyond payments. Ported PPP, implemented IP/UDP layers, and built a credit bureau query app within 14kB memory. Showcased in Costa Rica, later deployed on 2M+ terminals in Brazil, helping transform the company into a leading POS solutions provider.
* Optimized mTLS for resource-limited terminals by replacing a slow multi-precision arithmetic library in a commercial TLS solution with OpenSSL’s counterpart. Reduced handshake time from over 2 minutes to 2.5 seconds, delivering a lightweight, high-performance security layer.
* Developed a lightweight, single-threaded reactive middleware to resolve a critical integration issue with a major Acquirer. Deployed in production for over eight years with only two reported issues, it became the company’s most profitable product.
* _C, TCP/IP, TLS, OpenSSL, Linux Socket API, Cryptography, Assembly, ISO-8583, SNMP_
